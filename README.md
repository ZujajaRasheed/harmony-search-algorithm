# ðŸŽµ Harmony Search Algorithm (Metaheuristic Optimization)

This project implements the **Harmony Search Algorithm**, a music-inspired metaheuristic optimization technique used to solve complex problems by mimicking the process of musical improvisation.

Developed as part of an academic semester project, this repository includes:
- Detailed explanation of the algorithm
- Implementation code
- Flowcharts
- Time and space complexity analysis
- Real-life applications

ðŸ“Œ What is Harmony Search?

Harmony Search (HS) is an **evolutionary optimization algorithm** inspired by the improvisation process of musicians. Like finding the best harmony in music, the algorithm seeks the best solution from a combination of possible alternatives.


 ðŸ§  Key Concepts

- **Harmony Memory (HM)**: Stores the best solution vectors
- **Improvisation**: Generates new harmonies (solutions)
- **Memory Consideration, Pitch Adjustment & Random Selection**: Core strategies
- **Convergence**: Towards the global optimal solution


 ðŸ§¾ Features

- âœ… Fully explained algorithm flow
- âœ… Well-commented and simple implementation
- âœ… Flowchart for visual understanding
- âœ… Time and space complexity analysis
